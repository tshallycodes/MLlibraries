**ML-libraries**



ML-libraries is a repository containing code snippets I’ve written to learn and explore popular machine learning and data processing libraries in Python. 
Each folder focuses on a specific library, with examples to demonstrate its usage.


Purpose

A personal collection of hands-on examples for learning machine learning and related tools.

Quick reference for basic usage of key Python libraries.


Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each named after a library and containing snippets I used to understand its features:

np: NumPy - Numerical operations, arrays, and math functions.

plt: Matplotlib (Pyplot) - Data visualization and plotting.

spacy: SpaCy - Natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

textblob: TextBlob - Simple NLP and text analysis.

bs4: Beautiful Soup - Web scraping and HTML parsing.

sklearn: Scikit-learn - Machine learning algorithms and tools.


What’s Inside

Short Python scripts (.py files) with examples of key functionalities.

Comments in the code to explain what each snippet does.

No full projects—just focused, standalone snippets for learning.



Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/tshallycodes/ML-libraries.git

cd ML-libraries

Install Dependencies: Each folder uses a specific library. Install them with pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib spacy textblob beautifulsoup4 scikit-learn requests

For SpaCy, you may also need a language model (e.g., python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm).

Run the Snippets:

Navigate to a folder (e.g., cd np).

Run a script with Python:


Usage

Browse a folder to see examples of that library in action.

Modify the snippets to experiment and learn more.

Use as a quick cheat sheet for syntax and basic operations.


Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed.

A virtual environment is recommended:

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
